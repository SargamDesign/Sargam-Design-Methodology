# Sargam UI
Sargam UI is a free-form design system improvisation framework, made for creators who want to craft and deliver high-quality products with speed and scale. Helps you materialize higher-level concepts, such as design principles and brand values, into concrete interfaces without losing core design ethos.

From the design principles, brand & product philosophy, tonality, foundations, to libraries, conceptual models, patterns, and final deliverables. Sargam brings all of these together in a way that allows teams to think deeply, envision the future and produce at an elite level in terms of both quality and speed.

## Sargam design methodology
A methodology for creating strong, finely crafted and scalable design systems. Based on the aesthetics of Indian Classical Music. Sargam focuses on the unseen design systems problems:
1. Consistency taking over craftsmanship.
2. Inauthentic, strategic constraints.
3. Dying simplicity and clarity.
4. Busy, monotonous, gatekeeping work.

### Three distinct levels of Sargam design

1. Principles
2. Compositions
3. Inventory

### Level 1: Principles
At level one, the design guiding principles at the foundational level will be defined. Below are some of the key areas Sargam covers in Level 1, based on Indian Classical Music (ICM) aesthetics:

1. Colour spectrum (Swaras in ICM)
2. Sequential schemes (Shruti)
3. Typography (Alankaar)
4. Spacings & paddings (Taal)
5. Layouts (Dhrupad)

### Level 2: Compositions
Compositions demonstrates how the above principles have been applied in components, screens or patterns, and document extended or derived patterns for specific use cases. Sargam recommends to keep the compositions elastic, valuing craftsmanship over consistency. Compositions are further categorized into 3 subcategories:

1. Components (Raga in ICM)
2. Features/User stories/JTBD (Ghazals)
3. Apps (Gharana)

### Level 3: Inventory
Inventory aims to record foundations like design tokens, token translation workflow, insight framework, how we work, how we name files, how we organize them, design tools, developers hand-off guides etc.

A collection of standardized formats to keep all stakeholders aligned and accelerate design workflows across teams. Templates to empower the team to work in parallel and ship high-quality work with speed. Below are some of the key areas Sargam UI inventory provides:

1. Design tokens & translation workflow
2. Kick-off templates: Insight framework, How we work, Get started building, Personas, UAT checklist
3. Developers Hand-Off Guide
