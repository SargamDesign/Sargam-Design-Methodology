# Sargam Design

A methodology for creating strong and scalable design systems. Based on the aesthetics of Indian Classical Music.

From the design principles, foundations, voice and tone, to libraries, conceptual models, patterns, and design tokens. Sargam brings all of these together in a way that allows teams to learn, build, ship and grow.

The system that drive to scale, and gives flexibility and creative freedom for working with the unknown of the future. Helps you materialize higher-level concepts, such as design principles and brand values, into concrete interfaces.


## Three distinct levels of Sargam design

1. Principles
2. Compositions
3. Inventory

-----

## Level 1: Principles

At level one we will be defining the design guiding principles at the foundational level. Based on Indian Classical Music(ICM) aesthetics, below are the key areas we'll be focusing on:

1. Color Spectrum (Swaras in ICM)
2. Sequential Schemes (Shruti)
3. Typography (Alankaar)
4. Paddings (Taal)
5. Layouts (Dhrupad)


## Level 2: Compositions
This level demonstrate how above principles have been applied in components, screens or user stories, and document how other teams have extended patterns for specific use cases. Aim to keep the compositions elastic, which can adapt to current and future needs of your organization.

1. Components (Raga in ICM)
2. Features/User Stories (Ghazals)
3. Apps (Gharana)

## Level 3: Inventory
Inventory will be recording foundations like design tokens, token translation process, design process, insight framework, how we work, how we name files, how we organize them, design tools, developers hand-off guides etc.

A standardized formats to keep all stakeholders aligned and accelerate design workflows. Templates to empower team to work in parallel and ship high-quality work quickly. Define the inventory items as per your organization need or want.
Below are some of the key areas we'll be covering in Sargam UI inventory:

1. Design Tokens + Translation
2. Insight Framework, How We Work, Get Started Templates
3. Developers Hand-Off Guide

## Sargam UI
I'm aiming to release Sargam UI on Figma community, on or before 15th August 2021. Below are the guiding principles I'm focusing on for Sargam UI:

**Authentic** - No one like Sargam.
**Clarity** - Eliminate ambiguity.
**Crafted** - Thoughtful & elegant craftsmanship.
**Simple** - Keep it simple, human.
**Universal** - Welcoming & accessible visual language.
**Warmth** - Built for warmth and caring vibe.
