# Sargam Design

A methodology for creating strong and scalable design systems. Based on the aesthetics of Indian Classical Music.

From the design principles, foundations, voice and tone, to libraries, conceptual models, patterns, and design tokens. Sargam brings all of these together in a way that allows teams to learn, build, ship and grow.

The system that drive to scale, and gives flexibility and creative freedom for working with the unknown of the future. Helps you materialize higher-level concepts, such as design principles and brand values, into concrete interfaces.


## Three distinct levels of Sargam design

1. Principles
2. Compositions
3. Inventory

-----

## Level 1: Principles

At level one, the design guiding principles at the foundational level will be defined. Below are the some of the key areas Sargam covers in Level 1, based on Indian Classical Music(ICM) aesthetics:

1. Color Spectrum (Swaras in ICM)
2. Sequential Schemes (Shruti)
3. Typography (Alankaar)
4. Paddings (Taal)
5. Layouts (Dhrupad)


## Level 2: Compositions
This level demonstrate how above principles have been applied in components, screens or patterns, and document extended patterns for specific use cases. Sargam aims to keep the compositions elastic, which can adapt to current and future product needs.

Compositions will be further categorized into 3 main categories:

1. Components (Raga in ICM)
2. Features/User Stories (Ghazals)
3. Apps (Gharana)

## Level 3: Inventory
In inventory will be used to record foundations like design tokens, token translation workflow, insight framework, how we work, how we name files, how we organize them, design tools, developers hand-off guides etc.

A collection of standardized formats to keep all stakeholders aligned and accelerate design workflows across teams. Templates to empower team to work in parallel and ship high-quality work with speed.

Below are some of the key areas Sargam inventory will be covering:

1. Design Tokens + Translation
2. Insight Framework, How We Work, Get Started Templates
3. Developers Hand-Off Guide

## Sargam UI
Ship your products with confidence. Sargam UI is for creators, founders, designers, engineers, & product managers who want to ship high quality products with speed and scale.

I’m aiming to release Sargam UI v1.0 on Figma community, on or before 15th of August 2021. Below are the guiding principles I’m focusing on while building Sargam UI:


**Authentic** - No one like Sargam.
**Clarity** - Eliminate ambiguity.
**Crafted** - Thoughtful & elegant craftsmanship.
**Simple** - Keep it simple, human.
**Universal** - Welcoming & accessible visual language.
**Warmth** - Built for warmth and caring vibe.
