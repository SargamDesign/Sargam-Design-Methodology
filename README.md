A methodology for creating strong and scalable design systems. Based on the aesthetics of Indian Classical Music.

From the foundations, design process, principles, voice and tone, to conceptual models, patterns, style-guide and documentation.  Sargam brings all of these together in a way that allows design teams to learn, build, ship fast, and grow. 
The system that drive to scale, and gives flexibility for working with the unknown devices of the future.
